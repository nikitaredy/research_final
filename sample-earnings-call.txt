TechCorp Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript
November 15, 2025

CEO Sarah Johnson:
Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Q3 was another outstanding quarter for TechCorp. We delivered record revenue of $842 million, representing 47% year-over-year growth. This exceeded our guidance range of $800-820 million.

Our gross margin expanded to 68%, up from 64% in the prior year quarter, driven by favorable product mix and operational efficiencies. We're seeing tremendous momentum across all our product lines, particularly in our enterprise AI solutions which grew 89% year-over-year.

Looking ahead, we're raising our full-year revenue guidance to $3.1-3.2 billion, up from our previous range of $2.9-3.0 billion. For Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $900-950 million and operating margin of 22-25%.

I'm incredibly optimistic about our position in the market. We've secured partnerships with three Fortune 50 companies this quarter, and our customer retention rate stands at 98%, the highest in our company's history.

CFO Michael Chen:
From a financial perspective, we're in an excellent position. Operating cash flow reached $215 million in Q3, and we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and equivalents. 

We're planning to invest heavily in R&D next year, with capital expenditures expected to be $450-500 million, focused primarily on expanding our AI infrastructure and data center capacity. Currently, our data centers are operating at approximately 78% capacity, and we're planning to add 50% more capacity by mid-2026.

Our software subscription revenue grew to represent 72% of total revenue, up from 68% last quarter. This recurring revenue model provides strong visibility and predictability for our business.

However, I want to be transparent about some headwinds we're monitoring. We're seeing increased pricing pressure in the SMB segment due to new competitive entrants. Additionally, foreign exchange headwinds cost us approximately $12 million in Q3, and we expect this to continue into Q4.

CEO Sarah Johnson:
On the product side, we're very excited about several growth initiatives. First, we're launching TechCorp AI Studio in January 2026, which we believe will be transformational for enterprise customers. Early beta feedback has been exceptional.

Second, we're expanding internationally, with plans to open offices in Singapore, London, and São Paulo in the first half of 2026. We see significant untapped opportunity in these markets.

Third, we're investing in our partner ecosystem. We're hiring 150 new solutions engineers to support our channel partners, who currently generate 35% of our revenue.

I should note that we continue to face some challenges in talent acquisition, particularly for specialized AI engineers. The war for talent is real, and we're having to be more competitive on compensation.

Looking at our pipeline, I've never been more confident in our trajectory. Our sales pipeline for enterprise deals over $1 million has grown 67% year-over-year. This is our strongest quarter in company history, and I believe we're just getting started.

The macro environment remains supportive, with enterprises accelerating their digital transformation initiatives. We're seeing AI move from pilot programs to production deployments, which is driving larger deal sizes and faster sales cycles.

In summary, we delivered exceptional results, raised guidance, launched innovative products, and are executing against our strategic priorities. We remain focused on long-term sustainable growth while maintaining disciplined capital allocation.

Q&A Session:

Analyst Question: Can you provide more color on the margin trajectory?

CFO Michael Chen:
We expect operating margins to expand to 28-30% by the end of 2026, as we achieve greater scale efficiencies. We're making strategic investments now that will pay dividends in future quarters. Our long-term target remains 35% operating margin, which we believe is achievable by 2027.

Analyst Question: What's your take on the competitive landscape?

CEO Sarah Johnson:
Competition is intensifying, particularly in the mid-market segment. However, our enterprise focus and product differentiation give us a strong competitive moat. We're winning deals because of our superior technology and customer success track record. Our Net Promoter Score of 76 is industry-leading and reflects the value we deliver.

Thank you all for joining today's call. We look forward to updating you on our Q4 results in February.
